Solution index:
  * #think - further thoughts needed
  * #wikipieces (7) - for all NPs/NEs/nouns in question, include same-titled wikipedia articles in primary search; furthermore, do not split such to sub-clues?
  * #synsets (6) - include synsets instead of words
  * #abbrev (4) - acronym generation / expansion; e.g. PC <=> P.C. <=> Personal Computer; in expansion, try using #redirects?
  * #redirects (4) - generate auxiliary clues based on wikipedia redirects (and include these in search even if origin were CluePhrase), and a CandidateAnswer
  * #dbpedia (2) - information stored in tables and infoboxes; for enwiki, refer to dbpedia
  * #nequotes (2) - generate typeless (or "name", "title"?) NamedEntity instances from quoted strings
  * #import (2) - the enwiki import leaves some numbers/quantities off
  * #svlatclue (2) - generate LAT and noun-clue from SV and previous LAT (LAT "place" + SV "live" => "residence"; LAT "person" + SV "live" => "resident")
  * #stopwords (2) - useless words adding noise (but careful about "name" - only when "is name", not e.g. "received name")
  * #tenseclue (1) - add a very weak "current" clue for present tense, "past" for past tense
  * #verbanswer (1) - generate (ad)verb / verb phrase answers for "how" questions
  * #flexclue (1) - generate alternate clues for various verb inflections (or noun inflections too); e.g. "become" => "became", "becoming" ("becomes" is admitted implicitly)
  * #typofix (1) - run a spellcheck on the question
  * #subobjlat (1) - we would also need subject-object LAT (the symbol is X => X has LAT "symbol")
  * #cluetokenpos (1) - tweak ClueToken weight by the POS
  * #wncomposite (0) - if an NP has wordnet entry as a whole, do not generate clues for contained words; e.g. "body of water" shouldn't be split further to "body" etc.

This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[32] It was called Pennsylvania.
