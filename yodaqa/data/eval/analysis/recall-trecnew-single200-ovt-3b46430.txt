Solution index:
  * #think - further thoughts needed
  * #synsets (4) - include synsets instead of words; synset source can be wordnet or dbpedia (article titles and redirects, c.f. #concepts)
  * #abbrev (4) - acronym generation / expansion; e.g. PC <=> P.C. <=> Personal Computer; in expansion, try using redirects?
  * #svlatclue (3) - generate LAT and noun-clue from SV and previous LAT (LAT "place" + SV "live" => "residence"; LAT "person" + SV "live" => "resident")
  * #concepts (2) - overlap with #synsets, generate a concept match with dbpedia resource based on redirects/disambiguates, but this needs to be very careful about introducing noise
  * #stopwords (3) - useless words adding noise (but careful about "name" - only when "is name", not e.g. "received name")
  * #dbpedia (2) - information stored in tables and infoboxes; for enwiki, refer to dbpedia
  * #wikipieces++ (2) - capitalize all words in the enwiki title query; if it includes leading "the", try without it too in case of no results; try also generating from VPs
  * #nequotes (2) - generate typeless (or "name", "title"?) NamedEntity instances from quoted strings
  * #import (2) - the enwiki import leaves some numbers/quantities off
  * #flexclue (2) - generate alternate clues for various verb inflections (or noun inflections too); e.g. "become" => "became", "becoming" ("becomes" is admitted implicitly)
  * #verbanswer (1) - generate (ad)verb / verb phrase answers for "how" questions
  * #typofix (2) - run a spellcheck on the question
  * #subobjlat (1) - we would also need subject-object LAT (the symbol is X => X has LAT "symbol")
  * #cluetokenpos (1) - tweak ClueToken weight by the POS
  * #wncomposite (1) - if an NP has wordnet entry as a whole, do not generate clues for contained words; e.g. "body of water" shouldn't be split further to "body" etc.
  * #latnoun (1) - generate a noun LAT (and clue) - "deep" -> "depth" and such
  * #clueweights (1) - give more weight in passage filtering to SV clues
