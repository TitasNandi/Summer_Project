Branched fbpaths try to cover question which have additional relation to concept 
in addition to relation between question entity and answer. These paths have to have
one common relation. 

For example one path: tv/tv_character/appeared_in_tv_program", "/tv/regular_tv_appearance/actor"
and second path: tv/tv_character/appeared_in_tv_program", "/tv/regular_tv_appearance/series

This is typical for question which look like: Who played character X in film Y.

However not all question of this type was not answered correctly, here are some examples with 
possible reason of wring answer.
