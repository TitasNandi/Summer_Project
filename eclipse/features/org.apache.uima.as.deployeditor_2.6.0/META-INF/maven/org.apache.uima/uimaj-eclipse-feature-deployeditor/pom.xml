  <!-- Special inheritance note
       even though the <scm> element that follows is exactly the 
       same as those in super poms, it cannot be inherited because 
       there is some special code that computes the connection elements
       from the chain of parent poms, if this is omitted. 
       
       Keeping this a bit factored allows cutting/pasting the <scm>
       element, and just changing the following two properties -->
