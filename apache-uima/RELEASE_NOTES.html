<h2><a id="what.is.uima">1. What is UIMA?</a></h2>

     <p>
  			Unstructured Information Management applications are
				software systems that analyze large volumes of
				unstructured information in order to discover knowledge
				that is relevant to an end user. UIMA is a framework and
				SDK for developing such applications. An example UIM
				application might ingest plain text and identify
				entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or
				relations, such as works-for or located-at. UIMA enables
				such an application to be decomposed into components,
				for example "language identification" -&gt; "language
				specific segmentation" -&gt; "sentence boundary
				detection" -&gt; "entity detection (person/place names
				etc.)". Each component must implement interfaces defined
				by the framework and must provide self-describing
				metadata via XML descriptor files. The framework manages
				these components and the data flow between them.
				Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
				flows between components is designed for efficient
				mapping between these languages. UIMA additionally
				provides capabilities to wrap components as network
				services, and can scale to very large volumes by
				replicating processing pipelines over a cluster of
				networked nodes.
			</p>
      <p>
				Apache UIMA is an Apache-licensed open source
				implementation of the UIMA specification (that
				specification is, in turn, being developed concurrently
				by a technical committee within
				<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">OASIS</a>,
				a standards organization). We invite and encourage you
				to participate in both the implementation and
				specification efforts.
			</p>
      <p>
				UIMA is a component framework for analysing unstructured
				content such as text, audio and video. It comprises an
				SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic
				components written in Java and C++, with some support
				for Perl, Python and TCL.

<h2><a id="major.changes">Major Changes in this Release</a></h2>

<p>The flattened index support added in 2.8.0 has some edge cases where the
flattened version needs to be invalidated.  In trading off complexity versus
performance improvements, we decided to disable this feature for now. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4542">UIMA-4542</a>
</p>

<p>A few bugs were fixed in the CasAnnotationViewer
<a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4533">UIMA-4533</a>, a name-clash was
fixed in an internal method, which could clash with a JCas-generated name
if there was a feature that happened to be named "TypeCode" 
<a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4534">UIMA-4534</a>,
and the CasCopier code was improved to cover an additional use case
<a target="_blank" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4541">UIMA-4541</a>

 <h3>API changes</h3>
